# Instructions:
# Create a function that accepts a list of integers as an input and returns
# a list that contains each number spelled out. If the number is longer than
# a single digit, add the converted string of each digit together. For
# example the list [1,23,6,66,10] would be returned as
# [one,twothree,six,sixsix,onezero]. If a value in the list is not an
# integer, discard it.
#
# You may use the following when creating the function:
#  - str() - converts a variable into a string


def numbers_to_names(number_list):
    return
