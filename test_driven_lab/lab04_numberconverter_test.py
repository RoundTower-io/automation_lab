#Instructions:
#Create a function that accepts a list of integers as an input and returns 
#a list that contains each number spelled out. If the number is longer than
#a single digit, add the converted string of each digit together. For 
#example the list [1,23,6,66,10] would be returned as
#[one,twothree,six,sixsix,onezero]. If a value in the list is not an 
#integer, discard it.
#
#Create tests for the code that you believe would best fit for this function.
